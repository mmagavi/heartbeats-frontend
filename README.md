# About

heartBeats is a smart exercise and relaxation playlist creation tool! Our web app gives users the option to create four playlist types. After logging in with Spotify, users can enter their age, some genres that they enjoy as well as the desired intensity and length of their workout. If the user wants to create a relaxing playlist, they can enter their resting heart rate and some genres they feel will help them relax and the desired length to create a playlist to help the user wind down.
