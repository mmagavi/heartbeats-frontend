# About

heartBeats is a smart exercise and relaxation playlist creation tool! Our web app gives users the option to create either of the two aforementioned playlist types each with their own set of questions to create the perfect playlist. After logging in with Spotify, users can enter their resting heart rate, age, some genres that they enjoy as well as the option to start with a warmup and/or end with a cooldown(~10 minutes each: 20-minute min for cooldown + warmup). If the user wants to create a relaxing playlist, they can enter their resting heart rate and some genres they feel will help them relax and the desired length to create a playlist to help the user wind down.
